Homeopathic mesotherapy is a treatment to improve the condition of the skin and to combat cellulites, hair loss and many others.

This method helps skin look younger, radiant, better toned. It is a procedure for people who are looking for a healthy and natural, not chemical approach to health and a good appearance without any side effects.
Mesotherapy is a form of treatment which involves injecting microscopic quantities of homeopathic medicine into the mesoderm, the layer of fat and connective tissue under the skin, to deliver healing or corrective treatment.
“MESO” in Greek means “Middle”

#### The Method

Mesotherapy was first developed in France by Doctor Pistor in 1958. He used micro- injections of medicine at the area of the body where the pain or lesion occurred. He treated such conditions as sports traumas, rheumatism and infectious disease.
Later this method was developed for aesthetic conditions and became extremely successful in this area.
Homeopathic mesotherapy is very special because the substances injected include antioxidants, vitamins and cellular revitalization ingredients which are necessary to keep cells in peak condition.

They boost the production of the cell’s own collagen, which declines with age, increase blood flow and lymphatic drainage. In other words they regulate the function of the cell, protect it from attack and prolong its life.

Each session includes lymphatic drainage, massage and others painless procedures depending on the condition of the skin.

Positive results can be seen after, on average, one to five sessions. For certain conditions you may see results immediately.

Treatment should be repeated annually, over a period of 4-6 weeks, after the required results are achieved. However, this period will vary according to each patient’s responses and age.
