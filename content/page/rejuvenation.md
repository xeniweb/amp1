I use hyaluronic acid fillers that are specifically designed to restore natural fullness and create beautifully shaped,
attractive lips. The effect last between three-six months and then a repeat treatment will be necessary.
My works:

Dermal Fillers /for improving skin tone and elasticity

Specially formulated for skin revitalisation thay work by improving skin elasticity and skin sagging. Hyaluronic acid
filler enhance cheek, the tear trough, lines between the nose and mouth and to naturally enhance the lips. The treatment
could be combined with Botox.
The Dermal Pen

An incredible hand held medical device which naturally increases the levels of Collagen and Elastin in your skin. It
helps combat the appearance of scars, wrinkles, uneven skin tone, stretch marks, acne scars. Derma Pen provides advanced
micro-medical skin-needling, a procedure that stimulates the skin to regenerate and repair itself naturally and safely,
creating smoother, brighter, healthier, younger-looking skin.
Up to six treatments recommended with 6 weeks interval between the sessions.
Redermalisation

Redermalisation is an injection method that introduces small doses of Hyaluronic acid into the dermis. This improves
cellular metabolism and deep moisturising of the dermis. The quality of your skin will be improved from the inside out
with Redermalisation.
Hyaluronic acid is a natural substance found in intracellular spaces of the skin, playing an important role in
maintaining moisture levels and producing
collagen, giving the skin softness and elasticity. With age, this natural substance is diminished, causing the skin to
wrinkle and stiffen.
If you like the results of the treatments, you will most likely to continue with a few sessions per year. The effects
are cumulative; your body will slowly develop Collagen and Elastin over time.
