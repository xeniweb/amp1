A unique device based on ancient traditions of China and India. It deals with stress, relieves pain and inflammatory
conditions, boosts immunity, revitalises sluggish skin and reduces cellulite.

The device is made from one or more rubber pads pierced with specially designed small tacks made from different metals:
zinc, copper, iron, steel and silver. They produce galvanic currents in the body tissue and trigger a healing effect.

During Embryonic Development Genesis all nervous tissue and the epidermis of the skin are developed from the some type
of tissue -Ectoderm.

It means that our skin has a strong connection with our brain.
In addition the dorsal root of each spinal nerve is connected to a specific region or segment of the body and supplies
the sensory innervations corresponding to internal organs.
It is known as a dermatome.
There are 30 dermatomes, one for each spinal nerve.
That is why by stimulating the skin with massage, acupressure, acupuncture and even simple stroking we send a signal to
the central nervous system and as feed back to our internal organs to help the regenerative process in many cases this
can be very powerful for mental and physical ailments .
