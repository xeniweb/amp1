There is a well-known expression that the tongue is the mirror of the stomach but not everybody knows that the skin is the mirror of the bowels. Spending time at the beautician’s covering your acne with creams which, you are told, will “cure” the condition, taking antibiotics and hormones which destroy stomach and gut flora, or simply covering the skin
with layers of make up is not the answer.
When I see a client my approach is both simple and complex at the same time. Let’s find out where the problem really is. And to my question: Is there any problem with your stomach/bowels, any history of taking antibiotics or hormones ? I have the answer “YES”.
So, let’s start from there.
My approach to the problem is simple and unique: a special anti-acne diet, homeopathy, acupuncture, vitamins and supplements. Homeopathy and acupuncture have a profound effect on health. They boost the immune system, detoxify and help the body to fight the problem.
In combination these therapies normalise stomach/bowel flora, digestion and finally improve the condition of the skin.
The process takes from 2-6 months depending on skin condition and the age of the patient.
The result is not just improvement but eradication of the basic causes of the skin condition.
You will need to visit me every 2 months to check your progress and make any necessary adjustments to the regime I prescribe.

Professional Skin Needling
Could be used for:
Acne scars
Photo-damaged & aging skin
Facial and décolleté lines and wrinkles
Stretch marks
Making the skin smoother, brighter, rejuvenated.
The EDS, a German electrically powered medically-engineered product, helps to make your skin younger and healthier looking. The EDS device provides advanced, electronic micro skin-needling. During the procedure thousands of micro needles penetrate the dermis of the skin. To be able to repair itself, skin starts a process of natural regeneration by
boosting the production of collagen, and increases blood, hormone and lymphatic stimulation. Moreover, a high quality hyaluronic acid solution applied on the skin during the procedure immediately penetrates the skin for to give a rejuvenating effect.

How will you feel during the procedure?
The procedure has a good comfort level with the help of a topically applied anaesthetic cream and takes from 30min to 1 hour, dependent on the area involved. I normally recommend three procedures with a 4-6 weeks interval depending on skin condition. It may be necessary to increase the number of treatments required. For the most beneficial outcome
homeopathic collagen and placenta injections between the sessions help to achieve maximum result. You will be supplied with anti-inflammatory, calming cream for use during treatment.
What happens immediately after the procedure?
The intensity of the procedure depends on the condition of the skin. After the procedure you will look as though you have had moderate to intense sunburn. Your skin will feel warm and tighter than usual. It will start to subside after one-two hours and will return to normal within 24-48 hours. After the procedure you will apply a post-procedure gel to help soothe and calm the skin. Application of high level sun and photo protection (SPF50) is also essential after the procedure throughout the year.
