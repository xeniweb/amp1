What do you offer that I cannot get from my own GP?

A first of all I offer time. I do not have a waiting room full of anxious patients to whom I can devote only a few
minutes. I do not look at my watch while I talk to you for a few minutes before I reach for my prescription pad. I
listen to what you have to say and ask questions that help me diagnose your problem.

Secondly I think in terms of the whole of you – your body, mind and spirit. I have an integrative approach to health.
Thirdly, I use my training, experience and skills as a qualified medical doctor, a homeopath, acupuncturist and
mesotherapist to devise a programme of treatment which is tailored to your individual requirements.

What medical conditions do you specialize in?

A my main focus is on aging and the diseases and conditions associated with it. I treat obesity, addiction, overeating,
deterioration in skin tone, dietary problems, cellulitis.

Can you help with skin problems like acne and eczema?

Yes, I can. Skin problems are among the most disturbing and their treatment is complicated. The skin is the largest
organ in the body, occupying almost 2m² of the surface area. The skin provides many clues to the general health of the
body. If we say that the eyes are the mirror of our soul, then the skin is the mirror of our lungs and intestine. My
approach to the skin problems is always complex.
I properly exam and analyze the patinet’s medical history, emotional state of my client and make it clear that treatment
will require diet, supplements, homeopathic and acupuncture treatment. Problems such as eczema and acne can be cured
over a period of from 4 months to 1 year depend on the severity of the problem. Disease should be treated from inside to
avoid future complications.

What part do acupuncture, homeopathy and mesotherapy play in your treatment?

A Acupuncture, the application of needles to various parts of the body, stimulates organs to function correctly.
Homeopathy uses natural, non-synthetic medicines with a proven track record of success to detoxify and re-introduce
harmony and synchronicity to the body. Mesotherapy uses homeopathic remedies for subcutaneous injection to reduce
wrinkles on the face. I also pay great attention to diet and life-style, important factors in establishing a healthy
organism.

What are your qualifications?

I am qualified and experience medical doctor I was also educated in acupuncture and homeopathy and successfully was
using it in my medical practice in Ukraine. I was studied mesotherapy in England, France and Belgium following many
others courses in this country and abroad. I have been in private practice in the UK for the last twenty years.

Do you treat skin conditions with antibiotics and steroids as GPs usually do?

I am a great believer in antibiotics. But skin problems require a deeper and more complicated approach. The skin is an
organ, not just a covering for the face. I won’t mask the condition with cream or antibiotics. As a homeopath, I know
that treatment of this kind will just drive the problem deeper into the body
